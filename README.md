# Full-Stack-REST-API
 Full Stack App with React and a REST API

 Using React to create a client for an existing school database REST API (that was created in a previous project). The full stack application provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.

 Used `npx create-react-app client` to create React project in a folder named client.Copied the REST API Express application from unit 9 project into the api folder.Installed dependencies for api folder with `npm install`
 Added CORS support to the REST API with `npm install cors`

 imported styles into index.js as well as moved the styles folder into the src folder
